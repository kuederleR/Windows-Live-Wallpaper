# Windows Retail-Type Live Wallpaper
This is an experiment attempting to use python to run a basic retail demo experience.

The software should look like this:

1) A video should loop in full scrreen on the Windows computer.
2) When a user manipulates the mouse or keyboard in any way, the video should disappear. 
3) When the user becomes inactive (stops manipulating controls for some amount of time), the video should sdtart looping again.
